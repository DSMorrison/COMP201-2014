= Lab 1: Software Setup and Pretest

== Install Git and frontends
[[install-git]]
Windows:: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/[Install Git Extensions]
+
NOTE: Install MsysGit, Install KDiff, and *choose OpenSSH* (not PuTTY); otherwise,
stick to the default settings.
+

Mac OS X:: http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev].
+
NOTE: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/[XCode developer tools] ships with git; otherwise, http://git-scm.com/download/mac[install the latest git from here].

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager. http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/[QGit, a git frontend] may also be available for your distribution.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

== Setup your course repository
[[setup-repo]]
IMPORTANT: You must use LeopardSecure, not LeopardGuest.

All platforms:: Paste this into your terminal (Git Bash on Windows):
+
----
cd ~
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrancej/COMP201-2014/master/starter-upper.sh | bash
----
+
NOTE: Press +Insert+ to paste in Git Bash.

== Install g++

Chances are good that you already have a C++ development environment installed
(e.g., Visual Studio, XCode). Chances are not so good that you have any decent 
(i.e., non-standard) libraries installed.

On your own time (outside class), please download and install g++ for your platform.

Windows:: http://win-builds.org/download.html[Download and Run the Package Manager]. Click *Process* to install.
Mac:: Install XCode through the App Store.
Linux:: Install g++ using your package manager.

== Pretest / Git practice

IMPORTANT: If you use Windows, first download and install
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html[a proper text editor]
(Notepad, Word and WordPad do not count). 

In Git Bash (Start (Windows Key) -> Git Bash):

----
cd ~/COMP201-2014                # Go into your folder
start .                          # Open folder in Explorer (Windows)
----

NOTE: On Mac, replace `start .` with `open .` On Linux, use `xdg-open .` instead.

Create a new text file in your COMP201-2014 folder called `fizzbuzz.cpp`.

----
touch fizzbuzz.cpp
----

In that file:

> Write a small program that counts from 1 to 100. However, if the number is 
divisible by 3, instead print "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, print
"Buzz" instead. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

If you have g++ installed, you can test it out on your machine:

----
g++ fizzbuzz.cpp -o fizzbuzz.exe # Compile the program
fizzbuzz.exe                     # Test the program
----

Otherwise, try your code out in http://ideone.com/[IDE One]. Select
C++14 in the list of languages and paste in your code to test it out.

Next, stage, commit and push our stuff off to ensure that `git` is working. You
can also use Git Extensions (or GitX or QGit) to do this.

----
git add fizzbuzz.cpp             # Stage fizzbuzz.cpp (include in next commit)
git commit -m "Git practice"     # Commit changes with a message
git push origin master           # Send work to your private repository
----
